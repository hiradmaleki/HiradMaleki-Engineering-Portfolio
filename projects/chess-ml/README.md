# Chess Engine with Machine Learning

This project explores the development of a chess engine as a testbed for machine learning and decision-making algorithms.

## Current Features
- Legal move generation using python-chess
- Random move baseline
- Board state visualization in console

## Dependencies
- python-chess
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib

## Planned Work
- Board evaluation function
- Minimax search algorithm
- Reinforcement learning (Q-learning or policy gradients)
- Move prediction using historical games
